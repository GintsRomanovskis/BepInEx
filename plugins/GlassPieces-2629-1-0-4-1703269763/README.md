>## ## Features

- Adds 27 new build pieces that you can use to build your very own glass house.

- You can get Silica Ores in two ways, one is by picking scattered pickable silica ores at the black forest, swamps, mountains and plains biome or two by mining silica veins which spawns in plains biome (do note that these new resources will only spawn at unexplored areas, if you want them to spawn at explored areas you need another mod called Upgrade World.)
- Configurable resources spawn data.
- You need to craft an Iron Hammer in order to build these new pieces.
- Uses serversync and built-in config watcher.
- Configurable through config file or [Configuration Manager](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Official_BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/)
