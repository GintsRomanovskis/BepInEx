## Location Generation Notice
This mod is best to use in a new map to let it spawn locations randomly (Holy Ground, Seal Crystals, and Damon's dungeon). Each of these location will attempt to place a number of them in different areas but others of each kind will disappear when one is discovered. Using this on an old map may or may not spawn these required locations but you may utilize <a href="https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JereKuusela/Infinity_Hammer/" target="blank">Infinity Hammer mod by JereKuusela</a> to manually spawn them in an area of your choice.
Here are the locations prefab names for reference:
- Holy Ground - Messenger_camp_TG
- Sealed Crystal 1 - Spawner_ScrollCrystal1_TG
- Sealed Crystal 2 - Spawner_ScrollCrystal2_TG
- Sealed Crystla 3 - Spawner_ScrollCrystal3_TG
- Damon Dungeon - TGDamon_Altar_Cave
